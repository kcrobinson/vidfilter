= Introduction =

VidFilter is a project to provide a friendly UI to the degrading of video quality across various properties (framerate, resolution, colorspace). It uses ffmpeg for most of its video processing functionality and Raven DB to store information about the videos created and maintained by the application.

There is not much to say at this stage as it still is in the beginning stages of development. You are free to check-out the code and send any questions to kcrobinson.


= Requirements =

In order to build and run the code, you will need the following:
  * Visual Studio 2010 or Visual Studio C# Express 2010
  * NuGet package manager (imports Raven libraries)
