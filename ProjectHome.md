VidFilter is a standalone Windows application that takes movie files and degrades the video quality across several attributes and keeps track of the movies created in a simple UI.

Currently released v0.1, the very first installation file. After installation, run VidFilter.exe from the installation directory. From the Admin page, you can load video files (You may have to click "Insert" more than once to insert the loaded movie into the known movie list, bug fix on the way). After loading files, the Filter tab allows you the capability to see a sample image of the movie as well as create a new movie from the loaded movie by decreasing the frame rate, resolution, or by changing the colorspace (yuv420p to 8-bit gray only support change at this time).

Please submit bugs and desired features to the Issue Tracking feature of this project page.

VidFilter is part of the MANOME research project at Eastern Washington University.
